## ðŸ”‘ Most Influential Factors

From the analysis, the top features influencing laptop prices are:

1. RAM (higher RAM â†’ higher price)  
2. CPU (processor family and generation strongly impact price)  
3. GPU (dedicated graphics cards increase price significantly)  
4. Storage type (SSD vs HDD; SSDs increase price more than HDDs)  
5. Screen size (larger screens usually cost more)  
6. Company brand (Apple, MSI, etc. are more expensive on average)  
7. Weight (lighter ultrabooks often cost more due to premium design)  
8. Operating System (Windows Pro/MacOS devices are more expensive than Linux/No OS)  
9. Hybrid storage (hybrid storage configs slightly increase price)  
10. Flash storage (smaller influence compared to SSD/HDD)

These insights confirm that **hardware specs** (RAM, CPU, GPU, Storage) and **brand/design** are the main drivers of price.
